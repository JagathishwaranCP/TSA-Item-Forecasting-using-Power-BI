# TSA-Item-Forecasting-using-Power-BI
This project focuses on time series analysis (TSA) and item demand forecasting to predict future sales trends and inventory requirements. Using advanced machine learning forecasting techniques and Power BI dashboards, the project provides actionable insights that help businesses optimize stock levels, reduce overstocking/stockouts.


# Project Overview
Developed a time series forecasting model to predict future demand for items based on historical sales data.

Applied ARIMA, Prophet, and Exponential Smoothing models to identify patterns, trends, and seasonality in sales.

Integrated Python-based forecasting results into Power BI for real-time interactive visualization and reporting.

Created dynamic dashboards to monitor sales trends, forecast accuracy, and item-level performance.

# Key Features
Interactive Power BI dashboard displaying historical vs. forecasted item demand.

Automated forecasting pipeline built using Python for continuous updates.

Visual insights into seasonality, trends, and anomalies.

Metrics such as forecast error (MAPE, RMSE) and confidence intervals for accuracy evaluation.

# Tech Stack
Languages: Python, DAX

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Prophet, Matplotlib

Visualization: Power BI

Database: SQL Server / CSV Dataset

Techniques: Time Series Forecasting, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering

# Impact
This solution enables businesses to make data-backed inventory and sales decisions, improve forecasting accuracy, and enhance operational efficiency through visually rich Power BI reports.
